The site was tested as follows:

Desktop:
- Chrome (Mac)
- Safari (Mac)
- Firefox (Mac)

Mobile:

- Google Chrome for Pixel 5, iPhone SE, iPhone XR, iPad Mini, iPad Air, Galaxy Fold, with rotated screens
- Firefox mobile device simulation for various sizes and viewport rotations

Based on testing results, these changes were implemented:

Aligned the button crowding in the index file in different browsers when browser window was minimized to 50% of the screen.
Updated font color for the checkout information section, so that the cart total is more visible on mobile screens.
Removed right hand side margins, padding and element size restrictions for mobile views @480px max width, for all pages.
Graceful degradation approach was used.
